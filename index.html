      I just wanted to take a moment to remind you how much you mean to me. Your
      love and care brighten my world every day, and I hope today brings you as
      much joy as you give to everyone around you. May your day be filled with
      laughter, peace, and all the beautiful moments that you truly deserve. You
      are my sunshine, and I love you so much! Have a wonderful day, Mom!
